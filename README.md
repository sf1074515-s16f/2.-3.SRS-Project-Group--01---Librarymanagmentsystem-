DESCRIPTION OF PROJECT=
                       The project includes making a software application to manage and organize library operations efficiently. It helps librarians handle tasks such as adding new books, keeping track of available and issued books, managing member records, and checking due dates. The system reduces manual work, prevents errors, and makes book issuing and returning faster and easier for both students and library staff.
